# Examples

This directory contains the hotloadable examples which use Zodiac:

run the app with
```
run-app.sh
```

and monitor changes to the source code by running the following from a separate terminal session:
```
rebuild-app-on-change.sh
```

make all your changes to the app package and it will be recompiled and reload as long as app-runner stays alive
